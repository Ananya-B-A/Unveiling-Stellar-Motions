### Kinematic Clustering of Stars Using Gaia Data

In this project I am comparing the pmra , pmdec , parallax and apparent magnitude of 10000 stars from the gaia dataset inorder to draw the relationships between each attribute.

I have visualised the relationships between each quantity and further included modeling and analysis of them.
